# A ZUGFeRD xml generator and validator

More info coming soon. See tests for examples.

# Some words of caution

1. This is an opinionated library optimised for my very specific usecase
2. While I did start to add some validations to make sure you can't input absolute garbage into this, I cannot guarantee factual (as in taxation law) correctness of the resulting XML.
3. This does not contain any code to attach the XML to a PDF file, mainly because I have yet to find a ruby library to do that.
